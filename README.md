# Geostrophic-adjustment
This script solves and animates the solution to a fundamental problem in geophysical fluid dynamics -- the Rossby adjustment problem; the shallow water equations (a coupled set of 3 partial differential equations) are solved numerically on a staggered spatial grid using centered finite-differencing and forward-backward time-stepping.
